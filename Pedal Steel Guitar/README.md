# Pedal Steel Theory Notebook

This document collects my personal elaborations on the Pedal Steel Guitar. Reason for writing up a notebook was because I did not find much material on the internet that centers around using the instrument in jazz, pop and rock music. I find the Pedal Steel Guitar sounding incredible in these contexts and I am mainly planning to use it for lying down chord progressions. When you are looking for country licks or something alike, this notebook will certainly not meet your expectations. There should be enough books that already approach the instrument like this anyway.

Please note, that I am neither a bookwriter nor am I particularly good at teaching. I still consider myself as a beginner on Pedal Steel Guitar and I only thought that writing this down could be helpful for some other beginners, too. Feel free to raise pull requests for improvements or error correction whenever you find necessary. Enjoy playing! :)

## The E9 Nashville Tuning

E9 Nashville (or simply E9) appears to be one of the most common tunings used on Pedal Steel Guitar. This section tries to elaborate on the possibilities of this tuning for accompanying jazz tunes.

Strings are usually numbered from 1 to 10, where 10 is the lowest node of the tuning. Here is the tuning:

| String # | 10  |  9  |  8   |  7  |  6  |  5  |  4   |  3  |  2  |  1  |
| -------- | :-: | :-: | :--: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :--: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| Note     |  B  |  D  |  E   | F#  | G#  |  B  |  E   | G#  | D#  | F#  |
| Function | 5th | 7th | root | 9th | 3rd | 5th | root | 3rd |  Î”  | 9th |

Notes:

- We have a dominant 7 together with a major 7 (Î”), which allows playing a dominant 7 chord (7th is in the bass) or a clean EÎ” 
- 7 and Î” build up a b9 interval, which is the reason why strumming all strings together does not sound extremely pretty
- There is also a pretty-sounding III- (G#-) hidden on the higher strings

Just for completeness (I don't think it's really helpful), here are the notes on the fretboard for the first 12 frets:

|  S/F   |  0  |  1  |  2  |  3  |  4  |  5  |  6  |  7  |  8  |  9  | 10  | 11  | 12  |
| :----: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| **1**  | F#  |  G  | G#  |  A  | Bb  |  B  |  C  | C#  |  D  | D#  |  E  |  F  | F#  |
| **2**  | D#  |  E  |  F  | F#  |  G  | G#  |  A  | Bb  |  B  |  C  | C#  |  D  | D#  |
| **3**  | G#  |  A  | Bb  |  B  |  C  | C#  |  D  | D#  |  E  |  F  | F#  |  G  | G#  |
| **4**  |  E  |  F  | F#  |  G  | G#  |  A  | Bb  |  B  |  C  | C#  |  D  | D#  |  E  |
| **5**  |  B  |  C  | C#  |  D  | D#  |  E  |  F  | F#  |  G  | G#  |  A  | Bb  |  B  |
| **6**  | G#  |  A  | Bb  |  B  |  C  | C#  |  D  | D#  |  E  |  F  | F#  |  G  | G#  |
| **7**  | F#  |  G  | G#  |  A  | Bb  |  B  |  C  | C#  |  D  | D#  |  E  |  F  | F#  |
| **8**  |  E  |  F  | F#  |  G  | G#  |  A  | Bb  |  B  |  C  | C#  |  D  | D#  |  E  |
| **9**  |  D  | D#  |  E  |  F  | F#  |  G  | G#  |  A  | Bb  |  B  |  C  | C#  |  D  |
| **10** |  B  |  C  | C#  |  D  | D#  |  E  |  F  | F#  |  G  | G#  |  A  | Bb  |  B  |

### Pedals and Levers

Most Pedal Steels should have three foot pedals, which are usually named A, B and C (from outer side of the instrument to the inside). 

Then, depending on the instrument, there are knee-levers, typically named RKR (right knee-lever right), RKL (right knee-lever left), etc. As being a left-handed player, I try to avoid using these terms, as "right" and "left" do not apply on mirrored instruments. Instead, for knee-levers, I will name them according to their effect on the base tuning, which is also a common thing to do.

It's also common to press two adjacent pedals with one foot at the same time. 

Some players seem to also utilize "half-pressed" pedals to only raise notes by a half-step instead of a whole note. For the beginning, intonation is already hard enough, so chords with half-pressed pedals are not included in this section. When your instrument has knee levers there should already be enough choices for all basic chord types used in traditional jazz music.

âš  Whenever roman numerals appear they relate to the scale degrees of the major scale (see [Roman Numeral Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numeral_analysis)).

#### Pedal Configuration

Even though pedals and levers can be configured to the taste of the player, I think there is a "default configuration" that players use, which is the following:

| Pedal | Effect                                 |
| :---: | -------------------------------------- |
|   A   | Raises all B strings to C#             |
|   B   | Raises all G# strings to A             |
|   C   | Raises strings 5 and 4 by a whole step |

##### A Pedal

| String #       | 10  | 9   | 8   | 7   | 6   | 5   | 4   | 3   | 2   | 1   |
| -------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Note           | C#  | D   | E   | F#  | G#  | C#  | E   | G#  | D#  | F#  |
| Bend Direction | ðŸ‘†  |     |     |     |     | ðŸ‘†  |     |     |     |     |

Notes:

- Provides the VI- chord (C#-)

##### B Pedal

| String #       | 10  | 9   | 8   | 7   | 6   | 5   | 4   | 3   | 2   | 1   |
| -------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Note           | B   | D   | E   | F#  | A   | B   | E   | A   | D#  | F#  |
| Bend Direction |     |     |     |     | ðŸ‘†  |     |     | ðŸ‘†  |     |     |

Notes:

- Isus4
- Very useful when being played with an adjacent pedal

##### C Pedal

| String #       | 10  | 9   | 8   | 7   | 6   | 5   | 4   | 3   | 2   | 1   |
| -------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Note           | B   | D   | E   | F#  | G#  | C#  | F#  | G#  | D#  | F#  |
| Bend Direction |     |     |     |     |     | ðŸ‘†  | ðŸ‘†  |     |     |     |

Notes:

- Brings in the 6th for the root chord
- Usually seems to be used in combination with the B Pedal to play the IV chord of a progression (again with a "country-sounding" 6th on the top)
  - Using the A Pedal can also be used for the IV chord instead and avoids the 6th on top, which I personally prefer

#### Lever Configuration

My instrument has five knee-levers, but I will try not to include many chords using the fifth lever as many instruments don't have one and also there are seems to be no usual "default configuration". Here comes the lever configuration:

| Lever | Effect                                     |
| :---: | ------------------------------------------ |
|  Eb   | Lowers all E strings (root) by a half-step |
|   F   | Raises all E strings (root) by a half-step |
|   G   | Raises all F# strings by a half-step       |
|  Db   | Lowers D string and D# string to Db        |
|  Bb   | Lowers B strings to Bb                     |

##### Eb Lever

| String #       | 10  | 9   | 8   | 7   | 6   | 5   | 4   | 3   | 2   | 1   |
| -------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Note           | B   | D   | Eb  | F#  | G#  | B   | Eb  | G#  | D#  | F#  |
| Bend Direction |     |     | ðŸ‘‡  |     |     |     | ðŸ‘‡  |     |     |     |

Notes:

- Provides the III- Chord (G#-)

##### F Lever

| String #       | 10  | 9   | 8   | 7   | 6   | 5   | 4   | 3   | 2   | 1   |
| -------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Note           | B   | D   | F   | F#  | G#  | B   | F   | G#  | D#  | F#  |
| Bend Direction |     |     | ðŸ‘†  |     |     |     | ðŸ‘†  |     |     |     |

Notes:

- Good for building diminished and half-diminished chords

#### Combining Pedals

Even when limiting yourself to using the pedals in combination with just a single knee-lever, there are already a huge amount of possibilities for chords without even moving the steel bar around.

Example calculation: There are 6 pedal combinations (no pedals, A, B, C, AB and AC), which can then be combined with the Eb- or F-lever, which makes 18 possibilities in total. This does not include your second knee, which would again increase possibilities.

Due to this high amount of possibilities, the main objective for the beginning will be to identify those combinations that provide good sounding chord shapes that cover enough material to accompany a song or a jazz standard.

##### AB Pedal

| 10  | 9   | 8   | 7   | 6   | 5   | 4   | 3   | 2   | 1   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| C#  | D   | E   | F#  | A   | C#  | E   | A   | D#  | F#  |
| ðŸ‘†  |     |     |     | ðŸ‘†  | ðŸ‘†  |     | ðŸ‘†  |     |     |

Notes:

- IV chord (A)

##### BC Pedal

| 10  | 9   | 8   | 7   | 6   | 5   | 4   | 3   | 2   | 1   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| B   | D   | E   | F#  | A   | C#  | F#  | A   | D#  | F#  |
|     |     |     |     | ðŸ‘†  | ðŸ‘†  | ðŸ‘†  | ðŸ‘†  |     |     |

- IV chord with 6th on the top

##### B + Eb Lever

| 10  | 9   | 8   | 7   | 6   | 5   | 4   | 3   | 2   | 1   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| B   | D   | Eb  | F#  | A   | B   | Eb  | A   | D#  | F#  |
|     |     | ðŸ‘‡  |     | ðŸ‘†  |     | ðŸ‘‡  | ðŸ‘†  |     |     |

- V chord (B7)

### Base-Chords-by-Type Lookup Table

A beautiful trait of Pedal Steel Guitars as compared to a simple Lap Steel Guitars is that a player has many more choices to build complex chord progressions for melody accompaniment. On Lap Steel Guitar, playing complex chord progressions requires a lot of movements (does not always sound so good), slants (holding the steel bar at an angle) or it is even impossible without individual necks using more individual tunings.

For this section we only look at chords that contain the root notes of a chord. Of course, choices are highly increasing when leaving out root notes. However, when using the root note in the chord, the chords sound far more obvious, which is useful when being practicing alone. Leaving out roots can be  beautiful when playing in a band context where the bass player already outlines the root notes of the song. I consider chords without root notes being an advanced chapter.

The following table summarizes available chord shapes for different kind of base chords:

|  Chord Type   | Abbr. | Pedals  |   Strings    |  Options  |
| :-----------: | :---: | :-----: | :----------: | :-------: |
|    Major 7    |   Î”   |         | **8** 6 5 2  | 9th (7,1) |
|               |       |   AB    | **9** 7 6 5  | 9th (8,4) |
|  Dominant 7   |   7   |         | 9 **8** 6 5  |           |
|               |       |    B    | **10** 3 2 1 |           |
|               |       | B + Eb  | **10** 8 7 6 |           |
|     Minor     |   -   |         | **10** 9 7 5 |           |
|               |       |    A    | 8 6 **5** 4  |           |
|    Minor 7    |  -7   |         | **6** 5 3 2  |           |
|               |       |    B    | **10** 9 7 6 |           |
|               |       |   AB    | **7** 6 5 4  |           |
|               |       |   Eb    | 8 7 **6** 5  |           |
|    Minor 6    |  -6   |         | **10** 9 7 6 |           |
|               |       |   AB    | **7** 6 5 2  |           |
|               |       | AB + Eb | **7** 6 5 4  |           |
| Half-dimished | -7b5  |    F    | **8** 6 5 2  |           |
|               |       |  B + F  | **10** 9 8 6 |           |
|               |       | AB + Eb | **8** 7 6 5  |           |

**x** = The chord's root note

### Example Voicings for Song Comping

In this section, we'll use the chords that we already came up with in order to play first song accompaniments. The best way to move some of the theory into muscle memory is practicing songs. 

Of course, this section contains only the chord changes of with a possible voicing. Feel free to exchange chords to your taste, learn the melodies or sing the lyrics by hearing the original records.
